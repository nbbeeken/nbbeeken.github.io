			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				Hi, I’m Neal, an aspiring computer scientist studying at Stony Brook University. There are lots of topics that
				interest me in the field of CS but I would have to say Systems C Programming and embedded systems are the most
				intriguing. These days a raspberry pi can be linked to a super computer halfway around the world and communicate
				in mere moments. The potential for embedded systems to have advanced applications is endless. While my work at
				Smart Transit, an organization that manages the tracking of buses for rider convenience, was limited to Android
				development I had the opportunity to experience first hand the applications of an embedded system to track
				passenger counts or detect potholes. I am a practical computer scientist, an inventor and a tinkerer. I’m always
				looking to build something new with the latest available tech.
