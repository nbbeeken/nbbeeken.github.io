					<h3>dashmips</h3>
					<p>
						Utilizing the awesome power of python decorators I have built a WIP MIPS assembly interpreter called
						Dashmips. The goal is to create an educational tool for teaching low-level assembly programming in an
						environment that is easily extensible and completely controlled.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the python cli tool that 'compiles &amp; runs' MIPS assembly a VSCode extension has been
						developed to allow for line by line debugging and register value inspection while executing your wonderful
						MIPS creation.
					</p>
					<p>Bye bye Javascript, sayonara C++, hasta nunca Go. MIPS is the new lang in town!</p>

					<h2>c_koans</h2>
					<p>
						A kōan 公案 (pinyin: gōng'àn) is a story, question, or statement, which is used in Zen practice to provoke
						the “great doubt” and test a student's progress in Zen practice.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inspired by ruby koans you may learn the syntax and practices of C through a series of lessons in the form
						of Unit tests. These prepared tests are all failing, by going through each one and repairing them to make
						them pass you will learn a small component of the C programming language.
					</p>
					<p>The test are written in the Criterion unit testing library.</p>
