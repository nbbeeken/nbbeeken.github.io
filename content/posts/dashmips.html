		Utilizing the awesome power of python decorators I have built a WIP MIPS assembly interpreter called
		<code>Dashmips</code>. The goal is to create an educational tool for teaching low-level assembly programming in an
		environment that is easily extensible and completely controlled.

	<p>
		In addition to the python cli tool that 'compiles & runs' MIPS assembly a VSCode extension has been developed to
		allow for line by line debugging and register value inspection while executing your wonderful MIPS creation.

	<p>Bye bye Javascript, sayonara C++, hasta nunca Go. MIPS is the new lang in town!</p>
