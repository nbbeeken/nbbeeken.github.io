				<p>
					A kōan 公案 (pinyin: gōng'àn) is a story, question, or statement, which is used in Zen practice to provoke the
					“great doubt” and test a student's progress in Zen practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Inspired by ruby koans you may learn the syntax and practices of C through a series of lessons in the form of
					Unit tests. These prepared tests are all failing, by going through each one and repairing them to make them
					pass you will learn a small component of the C programming language.
				</p>
				<p>The test are written in the Criterion unit testing library.</p>
