				<h1>dashmips</h1>
				<section>
					<p>
						Utilizing the awesome power of python decorators I have built a WIP MIPS assembly interpreter called
						Dashmips. The goal is to create an educational tool for teaching low-level assembly programming in an
						environment that is easily extensible and completely controlled.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the python cli tool that 'compiles &amp; runs' MIPS assembly a VSCode extension has been
						developed to allow for line by line debugging and register value inspection while executing your wonderful
						MIPS creation.
					</p>
					<p>Bye bye Javascript, sayonara C++, hasta nunca Go. MIPS is the new lang in town!</p>
